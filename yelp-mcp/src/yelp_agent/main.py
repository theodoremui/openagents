CRITICAL MCP STDIO REQUIREMENTS:
- All logging MUST go to stderr (handled in loggers.py)
- stdout is RESERVED for JSON-RPC messages only
- Any output to stdout that isn't valid JSON-RPC will break the MCP protocol

    Intelligent Yelp business agent designed for agent-to-agent communication.
    Handles any natural language request about local businesses through conversational
    interaction with Yelp's comprehensive business data and reservation platform.
    Returns both natural language responses and structured business data.
    Maintains conversation context for multi-turn interactions.

    CRITICAL: When recommending businesses, you MUST ALWAYS include the Yelp
    URL from the structured data to ensure users can view the business on
    Yelp directly.

    Capabilities include but are not limited to: business search, detailed
    questions, comparisons, itinerary planning, reservation booking
    exclusively through the Yelp Reservations platform at participating
    restaurants, and any other business-related analysis or recommendations an
    intelligent agent could provide with access to Yelp's full dataset.

    Use chat_id for follow-up questions and conversational context.

    Examples:
    - "Find emergency plumbers in Boston"
    - "What do people say about the quality of their work?" (follow-up with chat_id)
    - "Plan a progressive date in SF's Mission District"
    - "What are their hours?" (follow-up with chat_id)
    - "Book table for 2 at Mama Nachas tonight at 7pm"
    - "Compare auto repair shops from budget to luxury in Sacramento"

    Args:
        natural_language_query: Any business-related request in natural language
        search_latitude: Optional latitude coordinate for precise location-based searches
        search_longitude: Optional longitude coordinate for precise location-based searches
        chat_id: Previous response's chat_id for conversational context
